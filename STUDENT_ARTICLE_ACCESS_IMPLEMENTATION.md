# Student Article Access Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a robust system for students to access published educational articles while giving administrators full control over content visibility.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Default Published Status
- **All scraped articles are published by default** when added to the database
- Students can immediately access new content without admin intervention
- Maintains seamless content flow from scraping to student access

### 2. Admin Control System
- **Publish/Unpublish**: Admins can make specific articles private
- **Delete Articles**: Admins can permanently remove articles
- **Bulk Operations**: Support for managing multiple articles at once
- **Cross-Table Management**: Works with both `gk_today_content` and `scraped_content` tables

### 3. Student Access Features
- **Published Articles Only**: Students can only view articles marked as published
- **Unified Article List**: Combines articles from both database tables
- **Search & Filter**: Students can search and filter published content
- **Article Details**: Full article view with sections and formatting
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## Database Schema Changes

### Added Columns to Both Tables
```sql
-- gk_today_content and scraped_content tables
is_published BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
published_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
published_by UUID REFERENCES users(id)
```

### Indexes for Performance
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_gk_today_published ON gk_today_content(is_published, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_scraped_content_published ON scraped_content(is_published, created_at);
```

## API Endpoints

### Student Endpoints
- `GET /api/articles` - List published articles (with publishedOnly=true by default)
- `GET /api/articles/[id]` - Get individual published article details

### Admin Functions (Server Actions)
- `getArticlesForManagement()` - Get all articles for admin management
- `publishArticles(articleIds, userId)` - Publish selected articles
- `unpublishArticles(articleIds)` - Unpublish selected articles
- `deleteArticles(articleIds)` - Delete selected articles
- `getPublishedArticles(limit?)` - Get published articles for students

## File Structure

### New Files Created
```
app/student/articles/[id]/page.tsx - Individual article view for students
scripts/add-publishing-columns.js - Database migration script
scripts/test-student-articles.js - System verification script
```

### Modified Files
```
app/api/articles/route.ts - Updated to filter published articles
app/api/articles/[id]/route.ts - Updated to check both tables and published status
app/actions/content-management.ts - Added cross-table support and delete function
app/student/articles/page.tsx - Updated to use new published articles system
```

## How It Works

### For Students
1. Students access `/student/articles` to see all published articles
2. Articles are fetched from both database tables and combined
3. Only articles with `is_published = true` are shown
4. Students can click on any article to view full details
5. Article details page shows formatted content with sections

### For Admins
1. Admins see all articles (published and unpublished) in the admin dashboard
2. Can bulk select articles to publish, unpublish, or delete
3. Publishing status is updated across both database tables
4. Changes are immediately reflected in student view

### Default Behavior
- **New scraped articles**: Automatically published (`is_published = true`)
- **Existing articles**: All set to published during migration
- **Student access**: Only sees published articles
- **Admin control**: Can change any article's status at any time

## Testing

Run the verification script to ensure everything is working:
```bash
node scripts/test-student-articles.js
```

This will check:
- Published articles count from both tables
- Database schema integrity
- System readiness

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Content Flow**: New articles are immediately available to students
2. **Admin Control**: Full control over content visibility without disrupting workflow
3. **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
4. **Scalability**: Works with both current and future article storage systems
5. **User Experience**: Clean, responsive interface for students
6. **Flexibility**: Easy to extend with additional features like categories, tags, etc.

## Future Enhancements

- Add article categories and tags
- Implement article rating/feedback system
- Add bookmark functionality for students
- Create article recommendation system
- Add analytics for article engagement
